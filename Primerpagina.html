    Under blue moon, I saw you
    <br>
    So soon you'll take me
    <br>
    Up in your arms, too late to beg you
    <br>
    Or cancel it, though I know it must be
    <br>
    The killing time
    <br>
    Unwillingly mine
    <br> 
    <br>
    Fate
    <br>
    Up against your will
    <br>
    Through the thick and thin
    <br>
    He will wait until
    <br>
    You give yourself to him
    <br> 
    <br>
    In starlit nights, I saw you
    <br>
    So cruelly, you kissed me
    <br>
    Your lips, a magic world
    <br>
    Your sky, all hung with jewels
    <br>
    The killing moon
    <br>
    Will come too soon
    <br> 
    <br>
    Fate
    <br>
    Up against your will
    <br>
    Through the thick and thin
    <br>
    He will wait until
    <br>
    You give yourself to him
    <br> 
    <br>
